            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The artifact I’m using for this category is a project I built from scratch at the beginning of this course. It’s a Python program that launches a GUI via main.py, displaying the app’s title and two buttons. One button leads users to explore data structures (stack, queue, linked list, and binary search tree), while the other focuses on sorting algorithms. For data structures, the user can insert, delete, search, and search at an index, and view real-time visualization. Under the sorting algorithms page, users can specify the dataset size, minimum and maximum values, and sorting speed in seconds. After clicking "Generate," a dataset is created, and the user can select a sorting algorithm and click "Visualize" to watch it sort the data in real time through color-based animations. Users can adjust the speed before or after sorting sessions for a customized learning experience.
</p>
            
            <h3>Justify Inclusion</h3>
            <p>I selected this project because I’ve always wanted to explore sorting algorithm visualizations and build an educational tool for new programmers. It showcases my ability to apply algorithm and data structure knowledge while creating a functional and interactive GUI using Python’s tkinter library. I hand-coded each data structure and sorting algorithm, demonstrating a solid grasp of their underlying logic. Visualizing these algorithms effectively required a deep understanding of how they work, especially when breaking them down into steps that could be animated and easily understood.
</p>
          <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
          <p>
            In Module One, I had thought I would only accomplish the third course outcome, “Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.” After completing this project, I realized I also achieved the fourth outcome, which involves using modern tools and techniques. By building an interactive Python GUI, I applied relevant technologies to deliver a valuable educational experience. One notable difference from module 1 is that I am no longer using matplotlib for the sorting algorithm visualization. Instead, I opted to use the tools provided in the tkinter library to draw the dataset and visualize it.
          </p>
            
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
          	Creating this project from scratch, especially using a tool I hadn’t worked with before, came with its difficulties. One of the biggest surprises was how much time and effort the UI required, not just in layout, but in making it intuitive and visually meaningful. I also learned a lot about visual communication in programming and conveying certain aspects of a sorting algorithm, so it is easily digestible. Additionally, I learned how to represent data structures and algorithms in a way that’s both accurate and accessible to learners. The experience pushed me to solve problems creatively and strengthen my technical and design skills.
