            <h2>Enhancement 1: GrocConnect UI </h2>
            
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The artifact I chose to enhance is a frequency counter program written in C++, designed to process a text file containing grocery item names and count how often each item appears. It utilizes mapping techniques, utilizing a hash map or a dictionary to store item frequencies efficiently. This program was originally developed in 2023 as part of CS-210, an early part of my college career, it served as a foundational project in data processing and algorithm implementation. Now, I am transforming it into a full-stack MEAN application, expanding its capabilities by introducing a web-based interface and an admin SPA for managing inventory data.</p>
            
            <h3>Justify Inclusion</h3>
            <p>This artifact belongs in my ePortfolio because it represents one of the first classes where I explored object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and demonstrated proficiency in that area. Additionally, it showcases my ability to design a functional user interface within a command-line environment. The program is also modular, with well-structured methods that can be reused in other applications. Beyond its original form, this artifact has been significantly enhanced starting from a simple frequency counter into a full-stack implementation built from scratch. This transformation highlights my growth in web development, UI design, and user functionality, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.

          <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
          <p>
            In Module One, I aligned this enhancement with the first, second, and fourth course outcomes. While I have made great strides in these areas, there is still room for improvement before I achieve full proficiency. Even though some buttons are non-functional in this version, the user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. However, the middleware and server-side components are fully operational. To track my progress, I utilized Git as a version control system, allowing other developers to review my development over time. This also serves as a demonstration of my visual and written communication skills. Among the listed course outcomes, I believe I have achieved proficiency in the fourth one. By leveraging modern development tools, I have successfully built a full-stack web server using Node.js and Express, with dynamic webpages using Handlebars along with HTML and Tailwind CSS, to create a responsive and intuitive website.
          </p>
            
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
          	I have gained a deeper understanding of web server development and the intricate relationship between the front end of a website and how the server delivers functionality through JavaScript and HTML. One of the challenges I faced was setting up the server correctly. To ensure I adhered to industry standards and implemented proper error handling in the console output, I revisited material from a previous course on web server development. This experience reinforced best practices and improved my ability to debug and structure a robust server-side application.
